####How to Contribute

Build something cool with Burner?

We're constantly working on adding more hooks into your phone number, and we'd love to hear about the apps and hacks you are building 
for your burners.

If you have something you want to contribute, simply:

* clone this repository
* add a markdown file to this directory 
* submit a pull request

We'll then quickly review it and publish it so the rest of the community can see what you've built.

We hope this becomes a great resource for others looking for ideas on how to get the most out of their Burner.
